  schools:
    method: Using a proximity analysis along the existing road network, this map identifies the areas that are most- and least-accessible to schools. The analysis includes all facilities classified in OpenStreetMap as a school, kindergarten, college or university. Note that there may be more schools that are not included in OpenStreetMap.

# SECTION 9 POPULATION DYNAMICS
FCS_demographics:
  population_growth:
    method: Population figures are typically used as a denominator for many indicators, and are a measure of demand for services. The line chart above summarizes the city's population change according to census and other public data. High growth of urban populations, caused by rates of natural increase (more births than deaths) in urban areas, migration from rural to urban areas, and the transformation of rural settlements into urban places, puts pressure on cities to meet the new demand.
    footnote: Wang et al (2022)
  population_density_chart:
    method: Density is calculated using the most recent census population recorded and the official land area occupied by the city, and is an important measure of how cities function. Higher population density enables governments to more easily deliver essential infrastructure and services in urban areas at relatively low cost per capita. However, such benefits do not materialize automatically or inevitably. Whether a city's population dynamics pose challenges or offer opportunities typically depends on the policies in play.
    footnote: Populations and areas are from CityPopulation.de. Note that the extents used by CityPopulation.de may differ from the AOIs used by the City Scans. 
  population_density:
    method: This map estimates population numbers per 1 sq.km grid cell. It provides a more consistent representation of population distributions across different landscapes than administrative unit counts. Knowing where people are is critical for impact assessments and intervention plans, especially those focused on service delivery, food security, climate change, network systems and natural disasters.
